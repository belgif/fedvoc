A functional working group composed of BOSA, eHealth, CBSS, MinFin and Smals worked together to standardize the most common business ontologies (Person, Organization, Location, Temporal, Generic, etc). 

The end result is a published vocabulary list of classes and properties, with their URI's, accepted by the Federal government as standard vocabulary. 

These vocabularies come from 3 sources: Federal Government services, Flanders and EU standards. 

Each vocabulary element has a numeric identifier (no meaning attached), a name (camelcase, English) and a definition.
